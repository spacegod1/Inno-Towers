              We assure our residents that Inno Towers is situated in one of the
              most secure places in Accra, as it is in close proximity to the
              Burma Camp Military post of the Ghana Armed Forces. Residents
              would benefit from well installed security measures and regular
              police patrols. The quality of roads, proximity to renowned malls,
              the Kotoka International Airport, and the central business
              district makes it most preferred.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the main roads, residents have access to a range of
              amenities such as bars, restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacies,
              clothing boutiques, and beauty shops. The neighborhood also offers
              excellent educational institutions, healthcare facilities,
              churches, banks, and even a university, Zenith College.
